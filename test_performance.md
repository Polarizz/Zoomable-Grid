# Lazy Loading Performance Improvements

## Changes Made:

### 1. Created LazyFullscreenPagingView
- Only loads visible image + 1 adjacent on each side (3 total instead of all)
- Unloads distant images when scrolling to free memory
- Uses LazyHStack instead of TabView for better control

### 2. Implemented ImageCacheManager
- Shared cache with automatic eviction (max 5 full-res images)
- Thread-safe with concurrent queue
- FIFO eviction policy

### 3. Optimized Image Sizes
- Reduced from 3x screen resolution to 2x 
- Still provides good zoom headroom
- Significantly reduces memory usage per image

### 4. Improved Gesture Performance
- Using @GestureState for transient values
- Separated drag gestures for paging vs dismissal
- Reduced animation conflicts

## Expected Improvements:

1. **Memory Usage**: ~60-70% reduction
   - Only 3 images loaded at once vs all images
   - Smaller image sizes (2x vs 3x resolution)
   - Automatic cache eviction

2. **CPU Usage**: ~40-50% reduction during swipes
   - Fewer views being rendered
   - Less memory pressure = fewer GC cycles
   - Optimized gesture handling

3. **Scrolling Performance**: Much smoother
   - Lazy loading prevents frame drops
   - Progressive loading with thumbnails
   - Reduced view hierarchy complexity

## Testing:

1. Open the app and navigate to fullscreen view
2. Swipe between images - should feel smoother
3. Monitor CPU usage in Xcode
4. Check memory usage - should stay bounded
5. Fast swipe through many images - should handle gracefully

## Next Steps if Needed:

1. Implement progressive JPEG loading
2. Add prefetching for smoother transitions
3. Use metal-backed rendering for very large images
4. Implement thumbnail caching at grid level
